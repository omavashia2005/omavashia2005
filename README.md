### 🛠️ Currently Working On
AI Research Volunteer @ ASU APG
- Developed instrumentation to analyze 10K+ LLM training epochs, enabling research on LLM generalization and grokking
- Produced 300+ Hessian top eigenvalues, loss landscapes, and weight norms to visualize and quantify experiment results
- Trained a small LLM on the Sol Supercomputer with NVIDIA L40 GPUs in CUDA-accelerated environments (PyTorch + Mamba), using Matplotlib for data visualization of key metrics collected during experimentation

### 🕙 Previous Work Experience

#### ✍️ LLM-Powered Patenting @ [IP Author](https://ipauthor.com)
**Tech**: Python · FastAPI · React · Flask · TipTap · Dify.ai
- Reduced feature development time by 50% by refactoring full-stack systems (Python/Flask + React), improving the
scalability and usability of AI-driven processes, used by clients like Google and Siemens
- Contributed to Dify’s open source AI workflow platform, enhancing the Python SDK with new imports, documentation, and
testing, and collaborating with the team to improve developer experience and workflow reproducibility
- Worked with a 5-person cross-functional team (tech lead, backend, frontend, prompt engineer, and founder) to plan
end-to-end features, conduct code reviews, and align on iterative rollout schedules
- Followed structured SDLC using Jira to manage milestones, branches, and PR workflows across full-stack deliverables

### Open Source Contributions

- 🛠️ (Open) PR to Kubernetes Python client (https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/pull/2420): Fixing a bug in RFC3339 timestamp parsing. Added error handling and unit tests to prevent crashes when config datetime strings are invalid.
  
- ✅ (Merged) PR to Dify’s Python SDK (https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/22476): Exposed missing imports and added documentation for `WorkflowClient` and `KnowledgeBaseClient`
  
- 📊 Published a musical scale classification [dataset](https://tinyurl.com/chromalite) on Kaggle with **400+ views and 20+ downloads**, built as part of [ChromaLite](https://github.com/omavashia2005/ChromaLite) — a PyTorch-based neural network that achieved **80% test accuracy** on deduplicated chromagram inputs.
