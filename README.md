### 🛠️ Projects

#### 💸 Expense Tracker & Secure Auth System
- **Tech**: Java · Spring Boot · PostgreSQL · JWT · REST APIs
- Built a complete backend system featuring:
  - JWT-based login
  - BCrypt password hashing
  - Custom AuthFilter, exception handling
  - PostgreSQL integration using JPA
- Implemented protection against brute force attacks and future plans include Redis for blocked users and rate limits.
- 🔒 Security-focused with scalable architecture and production-style layered design.

#### 🎼 ChromaLite: Neural Network for Musical Scale Classification
- **Tech**: Python · PyTorch · librosa · music21 · CNNs
- Created a dataset of 1,900+ synthetic music samples using domain-specific rules (scale indexing, no duplicates).
- Designed a custom neural network to classify 24 Western scales from chromagrams.
- Current phase: integrating rhythmic, octave, and polyphonic variation for generalization.
- Future plans include expanding dataset and training custom CNN.

#### 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction
- **Tech**: Python · scikit-learn
- Engineered new features and tuned hyperparameters to push F1 score from 0.73 → 0.91.
- Evaluated performance via log-loss, precision, and feature importance.
